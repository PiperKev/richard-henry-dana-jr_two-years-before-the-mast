					<p>Mr. Cooper. James Fenimore Cooper, 1789–1851, was the first American novelist to attract wide attention. His Indian stories were based upon knowledge gained from residence in a frontier settlement in New York State. Like Dana, he left college to ship before the mast. His experiences as a sailor furnished him with material for several novels of the sea. Of these <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Pilot</i> was published in 1823; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Red Rover</i> in 1828. <a href="preface.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Dress-coat⁠ ⁠… at Cambridge. The requirement of a specific undergraduate costume is today unknown in American colleges. When the custom was abandoned, or how it originated, seems difficult to determine. In this connection a letter from Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who probably knows more concerning Harvard traditions than any one else, is well worth quoting:—</p>
					<p>“My impression is," he says, “that we were required to wear a dress-coat to chapel on Sundays; but have no recollection of kid gloves or silk cap. You do not speak of the insignia of the four classes - that the Sophomores wore one black stripe on the sleeve, Juniors two, and Seniors three, the Freshmen not having any at all. These things could not have been very strictly inspected at morning prayers, for I remember my schoolmate, William Story, going down before me to morning prayers, wearing a camlet cloak entirely torn down in the middle, from neck to heels. I remember also Edward Everett Hale coming down from his room in the upper story of Massachusetts, when the bell was almost at its last stroke, having, as we Freshmen said, jumped out of bed, thrown all his clothes over the banister, and jumped into them on the way down.⁠ ⁠… Dana after his return from sea⁠ ⁠… became rather a swell than otherwise,”</p>
					<p>In response to inquiry, Rev. Dr. J. S. T. Coolidge, Harvard's oldest alumnus, and a member of the class below Dana, writes, "We were obliged to appear on Sundays and all public functions in a dress-coat — nothing about caps and nothing about gloves." <a href="chapter-1.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This word “lay,” which is in such general use on board ship, being used in giving orders instead of “go”; as “<em>Lay</em> forward!” “<em>Lay</em> aft!” “<em>Lay</em> aloft!” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, I do not understand to be the neuter verb, lie, mispronounced, but to be the active verb lay, with the objective case understood; as “Lay <em>yourselves</em> forwards!” “Lay <em>yourselves</em> aft!” <abbr>etc.</abbr> <a href="chapter-4.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><em>Haze</em> is a word of frequent use on board ship, and never, I believe, used elsewhere. It is very expressive to a sailor, and means to punish by hard work. Let an officer once say, “I’ll <em>haze</em> you,” and your fate is fixed. You will be “worked up,” if you are not a better man than he is. <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>

				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Soger (soldier) is the worst term of reproach that can be applied to a sailor. It signifies a skulk, a sherk⁠—one who is always trying to get clear of work, and is out of the way, or hanging back, when duty is to be done. “Marine” is the term applied more particularly to a man who is ignorant and clumsy about seaman’s work⁠—a greenhorn⁠—a landlubber. To make a sailor shoulder a handspike, and walk fore and aft the deck, like a sentry, is the most ignominious punishment that could be put upon him. Such a punishment inflicted upon an able seaman in a vessel of war, would break his spirit down more than a flogging. <a href="chapter-17.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>When the crew were paid off in Boston, the owners answered the order, but generously refused to deduct the amount from the payroll, saying that the exchange was made under compulsion. They also allowed S⁠⸺ his exchange money. <a href="chapter-29.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>On removing the cathead, after the ship arrived at Boston, it was found that there were two holes under it which had been bored for the purpose of driving treenails, and which, accidentally, had not been plugged up when the cathead was placed over them. This was sufficient to account for the leak, and for our not having been able to discover and stop it. <a href="chapter-30.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The customs as to the allowance of “grub” are very nearly the same in all American merchantmen. Whenever a pig is killed, the sailors have one mess from it. The rest goes to the cabin. The smaller live stock, poultry, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, they never taste.</p>
					<p>And, indeed, they do not complain of this, for it would take a great deal to supply them with a good meal, and without the accompaniments, (which could hardly be furnished to them,) it would not be much better than salt beef. But even as to the salt beef, they are scarcely dealt fairly with; for whenever a barrel is opened, before any of the beef is put into the harness-cask, the steward comes up, and picks it all over, and takes out the best pieces, (those that have any fat in them) for the cabin.</p> 
					<p>This was done in both the vessels I was in, and the men said that it was usual in other vessels. Indeed, it is made no secret, but some of the crew are usually called to help in assorting and putting away the pieces. By this arrangement the hard, dry pieces, which the sailors call “old horse,” come to their share.</p> 
					<p>There is a singular piece of rhyme, traditional among sailors, which they say over such pieces of beef. I do not know that it ever appeared in print before. When seated round the kid, if a particularly bad piece is found, one of them takes it up, and addressing it, repeats these lines: “Old horse! old horse! what brought you here?”</p> 
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse"><p><span>—“From Sacarap to Portland pier</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve carted stone this many a year:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, killed by blows and sore abuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They salted me down for sailors’ use.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span>The sailors they do me despise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They turn me over and damn my eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut off my meat, and pick my bones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pitch the rest to Davy Jones.”</span>
					</p>
			</blockquote> 
					<p>There is a story current among seamen, that a beef-dealer was convicted, at Boston, of having sold old horse for ship’s stores, instead of beef, and had been sentenced to be confined in jail, until he should eat the whole of it; and that he is now lying in Boston jail. I have heard this story often, on board other vessels beside those of our own nation. It is very generally believed, and is always highly commended, as a fair instance of retaliatory justice. <a href="chapter-30.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The proportions of the ingredients of the tea that was made for us (and ours, as I have before stated, was a favorable specimen of American merchantmen) were, a pint of tea, and a pint and a half of molasses, to about three gallons of water.</p>
					<p>These are all boiled down together in the “coppers,” and before serving it out, the mess is stirred up with a stick, so as to give each man his fair share of sweetening and tea-leaves. The tea for the cabin is, of course, made in the usual way, in a teapot, and drank with sugar. <a href="chapter-31.xhtml#noteref-8" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>I do not wish these remarks, so far as they relate to the saving of expense in the outfit, to be applied to the owners of our ship, for she was supplied with an abundance of stores, of the best kind that are given to seamen; though the dispensing of them is necessarily left to the captain, Indeed, so high was the reputation of “the employ” among men and officers, for the character and outfit of their vessels, and for their liberality in conducting their voyages, that when it was known that they had a ship fitting out for a long voyage, and that hands were to be shipped at a certain time⁠—a half hour before the time, as one of the crew told me, numbers of sailors were steering down the wharf, hopping over the barrels, like flocks of sheep. <a href="chapter-31.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>I am not sure that I have stated, in the course of my narrative, the manner in which sailors eat, on board ship. There are neither tables, knives, forks, nor plates, in a forecastle; but the kid (a wooden tub, with iron hoops) is placed on the floor and the crew sit round it, and each man cuts for himself with the common jackknife or sheath-knife, that he carries about him. They drink their tea out of tin pots, holding little less than a quart each.</p>
					<p>These particulars are not looked upon as hardships, and, indeed, may be considered matters of choice. Sailors, in our merchantmen, furnish their own eating utensils, as they do many of the instruments which they use in the ship’s work, such as knives, palms and needles, marlinespikes, rubbers, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> And considering their mode of life in other respects, the little time they would have for laying and clearing away a table with its apparatus, and the room it would take up in a forecastle, as well as the simple character of their meals, consisting generally of only one piece of meat⁠—it is certainly a convenient method, and, as the kid and pans are usually kept perfectly clean, a neat and simple one. I had supposed these things to be generally known, until I heard, a few months ago, a lawyer of repute, who has had a good deal to do with marine cases, ask a sailor upon the stand whether the crew had “got up from table” when a certain thing happened. <a href="chapter-37.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
